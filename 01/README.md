# 01 - Testing Times

![](../img/witch-too-much-candy.svg)

In this exercise, all we need to do is make sure our Go environment is set up and everything is working right.

We have a Go package in the [`hello.go`](hello.go) file, and some accompanying tests in [`hello_test.go`](hello_test.go). We're going to run these tests and see if they pass.

**TASK:** In this directory, run the command:

**`go test`**

If everything is good, we will see this output:

```
PASS
ok      hello   0.186s
```

This tells us that all the tests passed in the package called `hello`, and that running them took 0.186 seconds. (The exact time can vary.)

## Done?

When the tests pass, you're done! Hopefully that was pretty easy. Go on to the next exercise:

## What's this?

This is one of a set of introductory Go exercises by [John Arundel](https://bitfieldconsulting.com/golang/learn) called [For the Love of Go - Fundamentals](../README.md).
